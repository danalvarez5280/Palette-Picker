# Palette-Picker

##  The original assignment asked for us to make a simple palette picker app that would randomly generate colors on a button click. 

## As well we were asked to build a relational database between a project name, which can be entered, and a palette of five colors.

## Last we had to use Circle CI to deploy our final app to heroku. [Here is the link](https://palette-picker-alvarez2.herokuapp.com/)

## Database built with Express, Knex and PostgreSQL.
## Back End Testing done with Mocha, Chai and Chai http.
## Front End built with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Jquery.
